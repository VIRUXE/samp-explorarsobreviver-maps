# Scavenge and Survive Environments/Maps/Levels

This repository contains a collection of environment design work from the [Scavenge and Survive](https://github.com/Southclaws/ScavengeSurvive) project. This work is from around 2011 to around 2017 though some pieces date back to the Hellfire days, so 2008-2011.

Not _all_ of this work is mine. However, it's been so long and the community members involved in helping with the project have moved on to other things. For this reason, I felt it would benefit the wider SA-MP community to simply open source everything.

The object placement data files are organised into categories:

| Path   | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COLFIX | Various points around the San Andreas world contain holes in collisions that allow players to exploit. This directory contains objects that cover these holes to prevent abuse.       |
| GEN    | "General", miscellaneous objects. Only contains shipping containers that block the use of Pay 'n' Spray garages.                                                                      |
| OCEAN  | Any off-shore ocean areas.                                                                                                                                                            |
| TREES  | `.tpl` files that contain tree placements. These were procedurally generated by the tree script in the main gamemode repository using the MapAndreas heightmap and the bitmap plugin. |
| LS     | Los Santos (city/suburban)                                                                                                                                                            |
| RC     | Red County (non-city/countryside)                                                                                                                                                     |
| SF     | San Fierro (city/suburban)                                                                                                                                                            |
| FC     | Flint County (non-city/countryside)                                                                                                                                                   |
| LV     | Las Venturas (city/suburban)                                                                                                                                                          |
| BC     | Bone County (non-city/countryside)                                                                                                                                                    |
| TR     | Tierra Robada (non-city/countryside)                                                                                                                                                  |

Design notes and random facts:

- `OCEAN` also contains the 20 hidden oil rigs that are located around the main map. These follow a grid-like pattern and the furthest rigs are 5 kilometers from the shore. These were designed as a "shell" for large clans to construct off-shore bases inside to store loot. The `development` directory contains for replicating the rigs. The original rig core is built at the centre of the map.
- `Houses` in each of the city areas replace some solid house objects with the hollow custom objects with doors and windows.
- `LS/Fort Defiance` is a Mad Max inspired fortification built around Grove Street. (Defiance was the old nickname used by Dogmeat around 2010-2012)
- `LS/LA Map.txt` I have no idea what this is, where it came from, or who made it... It's not very good though.
- `LS/Mall` is the replaced custom Los Santos hollow mall objects.
- `LS/DocksBuildingNorth` is a set of fences to provide a security perimeter around the large cargo ship docked at the Los Santos docks.
- `RC/Lagoon` was actually a deathmatch map from Hellfire.
- `SF/Naval Base` simply adds the doors back to the aircraft carrier to make it harder to get inside (high value loot inside!)
- `BC/pipes` was an unfinished project to build a network of secret tunnels between various points of interest. It was also going to tie into a cheesy subplot about Area 69 and secret government operations. The pipes were the custom stunt objects which were going to be re-textured with concrete.
- `BC/Rivet` was named after Rivet City, an area in Fallout 3 which was a huge inspiration for the Scavenge and Survive project. A game that both I and Dogmeat enjoyed!
- `LV/Dogmeat` appears to be just random objects located around LV. Dogmeat is also a good friend of mine who built a lot of these areas.
- `TR/DamBlockaid`, `TR/BcBridgeBlockaid` and `TR/FortCarssonBridge` were designed to slow down vehicle passage between Bone County and Tierra Robada in order to incentivise player-driven blockaids and ambushes. The blockages don't fully prevent moving from one side to the other but make it significantly difficult for vehicles to cross quickly.
- `TR/FortMyst` is named after a high-school friend's in-game nickname!
- Some areas also contain their own collision fix maps. I'm not entirely sure if there's any overlap with the `COLFIX` data.
- Files suffixed with `JP` are Jump Puzzles from the old Hellfire Freeroam `/parkour` speedrun minigame.
- The zone names match the standard zone names used in the game and in Scavenge and Survive's code.
- There are also `.tpl` (Tree Placement) files in zone directories.
